 sweden_negotiate.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Negotiates Company Partnership"
 sweden_negotiate.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] would like to establish a Swedish-African Trade Company branch in [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. The negotiation would have [FROM.GetName] pay a tribute to [ROOT.GetLeader] as payment for them to operate and have military access within our kingdom. No doubte this would provide our people with industrialization investments and modern guns. Though some fear that inviting colonial powers will only lead to them taking more land."
 sweden_negotiate.1.a:0 "We shall accept their proposal, may we hope they keep their word."
 sweden_negotiate.1.b:0 "We cannot trust these western powers! Decline them at once!"
 sweden_negotiate.1.c:0 "We are already in a company partnership with someone else."
 
 sweden_negotiate.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts Company Partnership!"
 sweden_negotiate.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] has timidly accepted the negotiation, hesitant that we may betray the agreements. Though for now our Swedish-African Company can begin operating within [FROM.GetName]."
 sweden_negotiate.2.a:0 "Excellent! We'll establish a branch in [FROM.Capital.GetName]."
 
 sweden_negotiate.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Declines Company Partnership!"
 sweden_negotiate.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] has declined our negotiation, explaining that it is far too common for westerners to lie and betray their agreements. Thus, they have refused to allow our company branch to operate within [FROM.GetName]."
 sweden_negotiate.3.a:0 "This is only a minor setback."
 
 sweden_negotiate.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Already Has Company Partnership!"
 sweden_negotiate.4.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] has already entered a company partnership with a different colonial power, and has consequently declined our negotiations due to this. We are unable to operate within [FROM.GetName]."
 sweden_negotiate.4.a:0 "Damn! We were too late!"
 
 sweden_establish_branch.1.t:0 "Swedish-African Company Branch Investment"
 sweden_establish_branch.1.d:0 "Now that the Swedish-African Company is officially established, [FROM.GetName] has invested infrastructure within the region. Although, with colonial investments come colonial officials. Some of our villages have had an incidence of scuffles with the Swedish colonists. With some of the colonists bringing in ideas of racial superiority, this has caused tensions to increase amongst the natives and Swedes."
 sweden_establish_branch.1.a:0 "While the investments are nice, the colonial officials are not."

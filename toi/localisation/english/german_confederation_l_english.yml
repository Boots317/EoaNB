##Country Leader Descriptions
HAN_GEORG_V_LEADER_DESC:0 "Despite losing his eyesight to both childhood illness and an accident in his teenage years, Georg V was still deemed fit to rule over Hanover by his father, Ernst August. His autocratic tendencies have led him to clash with the more liberal Hanoverian Landtag on several occasions, and Georg is not a very strong supporter of industrial development.\n\nInstead he prefers the old ways and continues to be an outspoken (and very stubborn) supporter of Austria and continued Hanoverian independence. Whether he will be able to help Austria maintain its strength and ensure his dynasty's rule over his domain will determine whether Georg V is fated to be the last King of Hanover."
HSD_LUDWIG_III_LEADER_DESC:0 "A military enthusiast and initially popular among Hessian liberals upon ascending to the throne in 1848, Ludwig III has since shown himself to be an ineffective ruler. The Grand Duke has not firmly placed himself in any political camp or demonstrated strong convictions and has largely allowed and relied on his ministers to make decisions and enact policies; he has however, gradually reversed some of the country’s liberal reforms such as freedom of the press and association. Wanting to ensure the continuation of his dynasty and Hesse-Darmstadt’s sovereignty, Ludwig has further aligned the Grand Duchy with Austria, and, to a lesser extent, France. If Ludwig wants to succeed in his efforts, he may need to reallocate much of his time spent being a patron of history and the arts to becoming a stronger and more effective leader."

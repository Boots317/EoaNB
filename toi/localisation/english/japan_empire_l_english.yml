 JAP_characters_emperor_meiji_desc:0 "Prince Mutsuhito was born on November 3rd, 1852, in a small house on his maternal grandfather's property at the north end of the Gosho. In our time, birth is culturally believed to be a source of pollution, so the imperial prince was not born in the palace. Instead, it is common for members of the Imperial Family to be born near the pregnant woman's father's house. In the case of the titled young Prince Sachi, his mother, Nakayama Yoshiko, was the daughter of acting major counselor Nakayama Tadayasu and a concubine to Emperor Kōmei.\n \nDue to the imperial lifestyle being so obscured behind closed doors, his youthful personality is contested. Sometimes he was seen as healthy and strong, somewhat of a bully, and he was exceptionally talented at sumo. Others describe him as delicate and often ill. But at his age now, he has matured and grown and is considered a proper leader of the people.\n \nThe young prince was born into an era of great change in Japan. This change was symbolised dramatically in July 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry and his "Black Ships" sailed into the harbour at Edo. Their smog piling high up, covering the horizon over the capital. For the first time in at least 250 years, the shogunate took the highly unusual step of consulting with the Imperial Court due to the crisis brought on by Perry's arrival. The talk of "unequal treaties," giving up tariff authority and the right to try foreigners in their own courts, spread throughout the country. After the shōguns' willingness to accept these treaties, Emperor Kōmei was so incensed that he threatened to abdicate—though even this action would have required the consent of the shōgun."

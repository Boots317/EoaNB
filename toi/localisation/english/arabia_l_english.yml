One unlucky British Sailor managed to injure himself and is expected to make a full recovery. over the 38 minutes it took for Khalid to surrender the British ships had fired over 500 shells. \nBritish Naval officials appear very smug over the whole affair, apparently busy fining the new colony for the shells fired"
